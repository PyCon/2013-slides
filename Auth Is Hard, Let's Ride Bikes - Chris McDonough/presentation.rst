Talk Format
-----------

Code-heavy talk.You're encouraged to obtain code samples by snagging them from
https://github.com/mcdonc/bikes or you can follow along online from there.

Evolve an application through no-security to too-much-security.

Principles
----------

We'd like to be able to defer thinking about security at all in the initial
stages of our project.

Although it's less understandable than ad-hoc imperative code, for larger
projects, making security mostly *declarative* is useful.  Declarative stuff
means fewer conditions; conditions are where bugs live.

Modes
-----

"Global" security: "Fred can delete blog posts", "Authenticated users can
delete blog posts".

"Object-level" security: "Fred can delete *this* blog post, but not *that*
blog post".  AKA "row-level security" in SQL-based systems.

Definitions
-----------

Principal: a user or group.  Often a string.  A single real person is usually
associated with several principals (e.g. Fred might be represented by "fred",
"Authenticated", "Everyone", and "group:admins").

Permission: a unique string representing an action, usually a verb.  "delete",
"read", "edit", etc.

On To the Code
--------------

We're going to follow code from here on in.
